# TODO
# implement:
#   diff::edits {old_lines new_lines} → edits
#   diff::patch {old_lines edits} → new_lines
#
# essentially edits is similar to diff but instead of copying all the
# text output one of these per line (or nothing for unchanged)
#   + lino text of line to insert
#   - lino
# so to do a patch, set pos to 0 and read edits:
#   if + then copy lines from pos to lino-1;
#	then copy text of edit line and incr pos
#   if - then copy lines from pos to lino-1 and set pos to lino
#   at end copy lines from pos to end
